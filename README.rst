Vesicle.py
==========

Vesicle.py is a software tool for analysis of immunogold labeled electron
micrographs. Specifically, it is used to analyse gold labeling associated with 
vesicle-like structures in membrane-enclosed compartments or other closed 
segmented paths. It is of course also possible to use the tool for other types
of two-dimensional spatial point patterns, and may also be suitable for 
analyzing vesicular morphology in non-immunogold labeled specimens. 

Vesicle.py is used in conjunction with its companion ImageJ plugin, Vesicle.IJ.
